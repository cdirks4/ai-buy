# Face Verification Bounty Platform Architecture Overview

## System Architecture

The Face Verification Bounty Platform is built with a layered architecture that separates concerns and promotes maintainability:

### 1. Frontend Layer

- **Next.js App Router**: Handles routing and page rendering
- **React Components**: Modular UI components in `src/components`
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first styling
- **Context Providers**: Global state management

### 2. Authentication Layer

- **Privy Integration**: Handles user authentication and wallet connection
- **Flow EVM Wallet**: Manages blockchain transactions

### 3. Face Verification Layer

- **Face Analysis Service**: Handles facial recognition and embedding generation
- **IPFS Integration**: Secure storage of facial data via Pinata
- **Comparison Engine**: Validates face matches for bounty claims

### 4. Blockchain Integration Layer

- **Ethers.js**: Flow EVM interaction and transaction management
- **Smart Contract Services**: Handles bounty contract interactions
- **Wallet Services**: Manages user and agent wallet operations

## Key Components

### Context Providers

- `AgentWalletProvider`: Manages agent wallet state
- `PrivyProvider`: Handles authentication
- `PersonBountyProvider`: Manages bounty interactions

### Services

- `PersonBountyService`: Core service for bounty operations
- `FaceApiService`: Handles face verification
- `PinataService`: Manages IPFS storage

### Smart Contracts

- `PersonBounty.sol`: Main contract for bounty management
  - Person registration
  - Bounty creation
  - Verification and claims

## Data Flow

1. **Bounty Creation**

```plaintext
Upload Face → Face Analysis → IPFS Storage → Smart Contract Creation
```

2. Bounty Verification

```plaintext
Claim Attempt → Face Verification → Smart Contract Validation → Reward Distribution
```

## Security Considerations

1. Face Data Privacy

   - Encrypted IPFS storage
   - Secure embedding transmission
   - Privacy-preserving comparison

2. Blockchain Security

   - Secure wallet management
   - Multi-step verification
   - Rate limiting on claims

3. Access Control

   - Role-based permissions
   - Verified user authentication
   - Secure API endpoints

## Future Considerations

1. Scalability

   - Enhanced face recognition models
   - Multiple blockchain support
   - Distributed verification nodes

2. Performance

   - Optimized face comparison
   - Batch processing support
   - Enhanced IPFS caching

3. Features

   - Multi-face bounties
   - Time-locked bounties
   - Reputation system
   - Dispute resolution
